# BigMart-Sales-Prediction-Analysis
This is a Jupyter notebook (ipynb) that demonstrates the important steps to building a predictive model
It follows the following process
  Hypothesis Generation
  Loading Packages and data
  Understanding the Data
  Univariate Analysis -- Exploring a single feature at a time to see for skewness, mean, median etc
  Bivariate Analysis -- Exploring 2 or more feature at a time
  Dealing with Missing Values
  Feature Engineering -- generating New features from existing Features
  Encoding Categorical Variables -- Necessary because most Algorithm does not support Characters
  Preprocessing Data
  Model Building
